If you’re anything like me, you’ve got tasks that require you to type the same things over and over. Maybe you’re sending **10+ emails a day** with phrases like “Please find the attached document as requested.” After a while, that gets **annoying**, right?

That’s where **Textra** comes in. It’s a simple tool that automates your typing, saving you from the repetitive grind. No frills, just smart text replacement that works everywhere you type.

## Why Use Textra?

### Save Time by Automating Repetitive Typing
Instead of typing the same email lines over and over, just set up a rule:
```
pfa => Please find the attached document as requested
```
Now, every time you type "pfa," Textra replaces it with the full sentence. You don’t need to think about it—it just works, **anywhere** you can type. Emails, Word documents, chat messages—Textra has you covered.

### Universal Text Automation
Textra isn’t tied to a specific app. It works anywhere you’re typing: email clients, chat apps, word processors, code editors. It runs quietly in the background, catching your shortcuts no matter what program you're using.

### Flexible Shortcuts
Got multiple ways you refer to something? No problem. You can set up multiple triggers for the same text:
```
:email | :mail => a@xo.rs
```
Type `:email` or `:mail`, and Textra will automatically insert your full email address.

### Multi-Line Text Blocks
Need to insert a whole paragraph or your email signature? Textra can handle that too. You can set up multi-line text replacements:
```
:signature => `Best regards,
John Doe
Project Manager`
```
When you type `:signature`, Textra drops in the entire block for you.

## Why Textra?
